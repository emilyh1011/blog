  on right edge of screen with flex and items-center.
  
  Turns out from root style, we set a max-width for our styles. Since my viewing screen
  width was bigger than tutorial person's, once I hit the 1280px, I go additional whitespace
  even though all padding was removed and made elements fit 100% width*/
